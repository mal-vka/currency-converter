## demo
https://mal-vka.github.io/currency-converter/

## description
This is a simple currency converter which allows you to calculate some common currencies with pre-declared rates.
It is made for educational purposes as a result of **first step in learning JavaScript** and further HTML&CSS training.
To build this simple website, I used:
- `if` and `switch` statements, function structures in block with `init` function and `addEventListener` method - to add wide functionalities of currency exchange calculation;
- the possibilities offered by the `<form>` element - the main part of the site;
- the semantic HTML and the BEM methodology - for clear and structured references;
- cdn normalize;
- OpenGraph tags.

## further development
Project will be evolving along with my programming skills.
- currently rates are fixed, so connecting with bank API will allow to use real time exchange rates
- added possibility of changing background-color with fancy switch button

## inspiration/source
The exercise scenario comes from the frontend course [YouCode](https://youcode.pl/) but is designed and created by me.
