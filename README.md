## description
This is a result of **first step in learning JavaScript** and further training HTML&CSS. To build this simple website, I used:
- the possibilities offered by the form element - the main part of the site
- the BEM methodology - for clear and structured references
- switch construction, function structures and addEventListener method - to add simple functionality of currency exchange

The exercise scenario comes from the frontend course from [YouCode](https://youcode.pl/).
