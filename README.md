## description
This is a result of **first step in learning JavaScript** and further training HTML&CSS. To build this simple website, I used:
- switch construction, function structures in block with `init()` function and `addEventListener` method - to add simple functionality of currency exchange;
- the possibilities offered by the `<form>` element - the main part of the site;
- the BEM methodology - for clear and structured references;
- cdn normalize;
- OpenGraph tags.

The exercise scenario comes from the frontend course from [YouCode](https://youcode.pl/).
